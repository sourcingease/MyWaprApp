# Fields Visible in Your Screenshots

## From the images you shared, I can see these tabs and fields:

### Tab 1: Incidents (Visible in screenshot)
- I can see a form structure but need clearer details

### Tab 2: Grievances (Visible in screenshot)
- I can see a form structure but need clearer details

### Tab 3: Fire Safety (Visible in screenshot)
- I can see a form structure but need clearer details

### Tab 4: Electrical (Visible in screenshot)
- I can see a form structure but need clearer details

### Tab 5: Structural (Visible in screenshot)
- I can see a form structure but need clearer details

### Tab 6: Health Hazards (Visible in screenshot)
- I can see a form structure but need clearer details

## REQUEST:
Since the screenshots you shared are not clear enough for me to read the exact field names and labels, could you please:

1. **Either**: Provide a text list of the exact fields for each form
2. **Or**: Confirm if the forms I created match your screenshots
3. **Or**: Tell me which specific fields need to be changed/removed

## Current Implementation vs Your Requirements:
Please tell me EXACTLY which fields from my implementation need to be:
- ❌ **REMOVED** (I added but you don't want)
- ✏️ **CHANGED** (Wrong label or field type)
- ➕ **ADDED** (Missing from your screenshots)

I want to match your exact requirements, but I need clearer visibility of the field names in your screenshots or a text description of each field per tab.
