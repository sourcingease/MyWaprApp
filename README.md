# SaaS Agent

An agent for your SaaS application.

## Overview
This repository will host an agent that connects to your SaaS application to automate workflows, react to events, and integrate with your APIs.

## Next steps
- Decide the implementation language/runtime (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go)
- Define the agent’s core responsibilities and interfaces
- Add environment configuration and secrets strategy
- Implement the first minimal capability (e.g., health check, ping your API)

## Structure (initial)
- docs/ — design notes and architecture decisions
- src/ — source code for the agent (language-agnostic placeholder for now)

## License
TBD
